# Lesson template

This is a simple project setup to quickly spin up code examples that can be run either with node, or in the context of Jest unit tests. It uses Babel to support modern JS syntax, including ES module (`import`/`export`) syntax. It also includes a `wallaby.js` file for streamlined demonstration via wallaby's test and coverage visualizations and smart comments.
